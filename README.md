# YouTube Downloader Tkinter
 
A YouTube Video Downloader that can download your video into multiple audio/video file extensions such as mp3, wav, avi, and mp4, and even cut your video at specific timestamps 
if you so wish!

Was built for the Unlock Hacks Hackathon!

Utilized the tkinter, PyTube and MoviePy libraries for this project!

Lets see how it works:

To start, find a video online that you would like to download and copy the link into the program and click "Search video":

If all goes well, the title of the video should pop up! If not, see if you copied the link correctly, or the video might be unlisted or privated.


You can now select the soon-to-be-downloaded video's file extension, and whether or not you would like to cut a specific portion of the video out:

Remember to input a valid timestamp, or you will recieve an error message when trying to download the video!
To finish, select a file location for your downloaded video:

After, the "Download" button should key-in; Click it, and you will be notified once the video is done downloading.
If you recieve an error message, check to make sure your timestamps are valid, or that you don't already have a similar file in this directory!

You should be able to see the final clipped (or unclipped if you didn't checkmark the box) video in your specified directory! Horray!
